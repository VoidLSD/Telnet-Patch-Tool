# TPT. Telnet Patch Tool
The telnet patch tool is a script made to assist IoT device admins in patching their devices quickly and securely. The tool closes common telnet and other commonly exploited ports to remote connections to implement a strong protection against botnets and other malware.

### Plans
My plans for this concept includes building a botnet that patches devices instead of hijacking them. The goal is to make the internet a safer and more secure place for all users and devices regardless of their technology knowledge.

### Install
```
1. Clone repository, Then CD into the directory.
3. python3 main.py
```
